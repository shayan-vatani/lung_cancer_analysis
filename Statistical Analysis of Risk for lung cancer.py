2Ô∏è‚É£ Statistical Analysis of Risk Factors for Lung Cancer
üìå Objective: Identify significant risk factors for lung cancer using statistical tests.

‚úÖ Steps:

Use chi-square tests to analyze categorical variables like smoking status, gender, and cancer presence.
Use t-tests or ANOVA to compare numerical variables (like age) across different cancer statuses.
Interpret p-values to determine which factors are statistically significant.
Create bar plots to visualize categorical relationships.
Generate statistical summaries for lung cancer vs. non-lung cancer groups.
üìä Key Insights:

Are smokers significantly more likely to have lung cancer?
Does age impact lung cancer prevalence?
Are there gender-based differences in lung cancer cases?
